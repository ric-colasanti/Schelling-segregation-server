                  Schelling's segregation model can be said to be the first
                  sociology agent-based model (ABM). Schelling took the complex
                  social behaviour of racial segregation and asked whether this
                  behaviour could be captured in a model by using some simple
                  rules. What makes the model exceptional are the range and
                  types of behaviours that this simple model exhibits. These
                  types of behaviours are known as emergent behaviours (i.e.,
                  population level patterns of behaviour that can’t be predicted
                  by looking the behaviour of each individual seperately) and
                  this is one of the first models of its type to exhibit this.
                  Many sociological ABMs can trace their lineage back to this
                  model. If you are interested in ABMs for simulating
                  non-communicable disease (NCD) is well worth your while
                  getting to know Schelling's segregation model first.

                  Schelling's segregation model does not directly address a NCD
                  but social segregation does play a part in a number of NCD
                  issues. For example, take a look at the Auchincloss model
                  example that investigates inequalities in diet in the context
                  of urban residential segregation.

                  What sets ABMsapart from other modelling methods is
                  population-level behaviour patterns emerging from rules that
                  apply across the whole model but are enacted by individuals
                  based on local information. In this case we are looking at
                  individuals' choice of home based on just the racial makeup of
                  their very local neighbourhood. The model asks the simple
                  question of what happens to the global level of segregation if
                  individuals make their housing choice based on how many people
                  are like them in the local neighbourhood. ABMs can model
                  systems and ask questions of systems like these because ABMs
                  model each of the different individuals that make up the
                  population.

                  This is a very simple model. In this version of the model the
                  world is divided into a 40 by 40 grid. Each cell of the grid
                  can either be empty or be occupied by a blue agent or a red
                  agent. Each agent represents a person. Each agent’s
                  neighbourhood consists of the adjacent 8 cells on the grid. At
                  each iteration every agent counts the number of agents in the
                  adjacent 8 other cells on the grid and notes the percentage
                  that are the same colour as themselves. If that percentage is
                  less than globally set level (the person’s preference to live
                  next to people who are similar to themselves) then the agent
                  randomly picks an empty cell and moves there. These are the
                  only rules, and are so simple that Schelling originally did
                  the first models by hand using a paper grid. In the version of
                  the model here the total number of agents in the model is set
                  with the population density slider. The global acceptance
                  value is set with the alike slider. You can change these
                  values and re-run the model with the reset button. Run the
                  model with differing levels of global acceptance. Not how the
                  behaviour changes around 30%.

                  This is such an important model that along with this web-based

                  This model demonstrates the effect of local individual
                  decisions on global measurable attributes, like the
                  segregation of a community. These global patterns of behaviour
                  are not immediately obvious from just analysing an
                  individual's behaviour in isolation, and demonstrate the
                  importance of looking at how policies that aim to change to
                  individual behaviours may influence global patterns, including
                  both positive effects or potentially unintended harms.
